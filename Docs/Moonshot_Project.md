<h2>What am I trying to do ?</h2>

Nowadays, we see more and more drones used for bad things (theft, smuggling, etc.), that make things difficult for the police and event the army have problems with illegal drones crossing country borders, so if we could at least reduce it as much as possible, why wouldn't we try ?

<h2>Why do I want to solve it ?</h2>

Since, in a few years, drone's deliveries will probably become more and more important, we need to find a solution to reduce illegal drone transports. In my opinion, that is one of the most important problem we will have to solve for the next few years

<h2>How do I want to proceed ?</h2>

To start with that, here is some basic informations.<br>

<ul>
    <li> A drone is able to automatically connect to every public WiFi network,</li> 
    <li> Using the WiFi, it is possible to connect to a drone</li>
</ul>

So if you create a program which can connect to an existing WiFi network and connect to the drone you can take control of a drone with low and possibly medium security level.<br>

But, I am interrested in trying to find a solution to connect to a drone with a high security level, and even cut the communication between the drone and its pilot.
