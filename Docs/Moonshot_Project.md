<h1 style="text-align:center"> Drone Control App </h1>

<h2>What am I trying to do ?</h2>

Nowadays, we see more and more drones used for bad things (theft, smuggling, etc.), that make things difficult for the police and event the army have problems with illegal drones crossing country borders, so if we could at least reduce it as much as possible, why wouldn't we try ?

<h2>Why do I want to solve it ?</h2>

In a few years, drone's deliveries will probably become more and more important, we need to find a solution to reduce illegal drone transports. In my opinion, that is one of the most important problem we will have to solve for the next few years

<h2>How do I want to proceed ?</h2>

To start with that, here is some basic informations.<br>

<ul>
    <li> A drone is able to automatically connect to every public WiFi network,</li> 
    <li> Using the WiFi, it is possible to connect to a drone</li>
</ul>

So if you create a program which can connect to an existing WiFi network and connect to the drone you can take control of a drone with low and possibly medium security level.<br>

But, I am interested in trying to find a solution to connect to a drone with a high security level, and even cut the communication between the drone and its pilot. -->

# What were my ideas?

## Drone control app

#### Status

${\color{red}{Abondonned}}$

#### Purpose

<p>This app was trying to help reduce illegal transport using drones by connecting to the drones, cutting the connection between the drone and his remote and control it to make it land.</p>

#### Why I stopped?

<p>After some searches, I append to found that even if drones with cameras were sending informations to the remote, there was only a small chance of working as the drones usually don't receive data.</p>

## Calendar / Agenda manager

#### Status

${\color{red}{Abondonned}}$

#### Purpose

<p>The goal of this app was to be able to add meetings in you calendar depending on the other meetings and tasks you had.</p>

#### How was it supposed to work?

<p>You want to add a meeting as soon as possible but you don't have time to search were you would have enough time for it, so by telling the app that you want a meeting of two hours as soon as possible, it will find the best option using your already planned meetings and your working time.</p>

#### Why I stopped?

<p>I didn't find that project ambitious enough and I think some applications can already do it ( even if you have to pay ).</p>

## People detector for lights

#### Status

${\color{lime}{On \ the \ drawing \ board}}$

#### Purpose

<p>When I imagined this project, I was thinking about people working in offices that often let lights on when there is no one in the room. So I thought that it would be a good idea to be able to detect in which room are each employee and turn on and off the lights if there is someone or not. Even if I first thought of this project as a utility one, it also help reduce the energy consumption for the offices and could be extended to other places ( eg: nursery where children go in and out of the rooms and where the lights are often on when there is no one around. )</p>
